# ROI Session Primer

Read this first, then `.memory/INDEX.md`. For the active work read
`.memory/rebalance.md` and `.memory/content-pipeline.md` — everything else in
this file is background.

## What Is This

**Rest Of Iryna (ROI)** — a multiplayer medieval text RPG Telegram bot in Swift.
Players fight rabid beasts, manage estates, trade, and duel. All interaction via
text + emoji + inline keyboards.

## Stack

Swift 6.2 (strict concurrency) | Hummingbird 2.22+ | Fluent 4.13+ / PostgreSQL 16 |
swift-telegram-sdk 4.6+ | AsyncHTTPClient | Lingo 4 (i18n) | SwiftDotenv

Router–controller state machine: each user has a `routerName` in the DB;
`TGUpdate → TGDispatcher (auth) → SessionCache → RouterStore → Controller[routerName]`.
Controllers transition by setting `routerName` + `saveAndCache()`.

Game code lives in `Swift/`. The content pipeline lives in `Modules/`. Never
`Sources/`.

## ⏳ ACTIVE WORK — pre-release rebalance

The whole game is being rebalanced before release. All content has already moved
out of Swift arrays into `content/data/*.json` (Phase 3, done); what remains is
the maths. **This is the only work in flight.**

- Plan: `~/.claude/plans/roi-session-primer-eventual-wirth.md`
- Tracker: the "Full Rebalance" section of `TODO.md`
- Decisions + calibrated math: `.memory/rebalance.md`
- Pipeline rules: `.memory/content-pipeline.md`

### Where we stopped

**Phases 3–8 are done. Phase 9 is next: content specifications, approved before
a byte of content is authored.**

The maths is finished and, for the first time, MEASURED. What remains is
content — and the rule is that the list gets signed off before it reaches JSON.

```
content/data/         manifest · items · enemies (+ archetypes) · recipes ·
                      rarities · sets · weapon_upgrades · bags · estate_upgrades ·
                      trader · tavern · market · guild · arena · master · plots ·
                      fortune · quests
content/data/tuning/  combat · vigor · exploration · progression · economy ·
                      time · budget
```

#### What Phase 9 has to answer

The simulator already named the content gaps, so the spec is not starting from a
blank page:

- **The bestiary is half-strength.** Every shipped enemy carries ~50% of the HP
  and ATK its archetype asks for (62% at level 1, falling to 48% by level 25), so
  all seven are a 100% win at 4–13% HP where the archetype asks 10–62%.
  `EnemyGenerator` regenerates the table from the archetype targets — that is
  Phase 10's job, and it needs a roster list first.
- **km 31–40 holds a single elite**, the `boss` archetype has **no members**, and
  `offHand` plus both accessory slots have **no items at all** (1.0 + 1.2 of slot
  weight sitting idle — it is exactly the residual the reference character prints).
- **Elites must not spawn below monster level ~14.** The mage's win rate against
  one is 93% at level 5 and its p99 HP loss is 100%, i.e. a death. The plan
  already specified the floor; it is a spawn rule, not a tuning change.
- **`ExplorationService.rollLoot` still keeps its foraging pools in Swift** —
  they belong in a `zones.json`.
- **Two flat rating bonuses survive the Phase 8C sweep**: `shadowVeilDodgeBonus`
  (+50 = 238% of a level-1 archer's dodge, 34% at the cap) and
  `defend.archerDodgeBonus` (+30 = 143% → 20%). Same rot the stances had. The
  report flags them every run; nobody has decided yet.

#### What Phase 8 left behind (the tools Phase 9+ leans on)

`swift run -c release roi-content simulate` rolls the SAME `CombatMath` the bot
calls — the maths lives in `ROISim` and `CombatService` / `User` / `ItemBudget` /
`VigorService` are façades over it, so a report cannot drift from the game. It
sweeps levels × archetypes × classes × play profiles × gear offsets and bands
level invariance, the p90 tail, win rates, pace to the cap, and the shipped
roster against its archetype contract. `--strict` exits 1 on a broken band.

Current state of those bands: **18 of 18 level-invariance rows pass, 0 broken
bands**, 19,437,688 XP from level 1 to 40 — 50–56 perfect days, which is a floor
rather than a forecast.

`EnemyGenerator` is the piece Phase 10 will lean on hardest: the archetype table
is a GENERATOR, and inverting its targets reproduces every shipped enemy's DEF,
crit and dodge to within rounding. Run at design time and frozen — never at
runtime, which is how gear upgrades evaporate.

#### The model, compressed

```
budget(itemLevel, slot, rarity) = slotWeight · (6.0 + 1.5·itemLevel) · rarityBudget
```

Every stat an item carries is that budget spent at fixed exchange rates, and the
combat denominators were derived from the same curve — so an item that respects
its budget cannot move any stat's percentage. Rarity multiplies budget ×1.00→×1.45
while value goes ×1→×16 (decoupled on purpose). Enchant is `1 + 4% × level` of the
item's OWN budget, capped at +20%. Sets grant thresholds at 2/4/6 pieces. Gear
carries HP as a sixth stat.

**Nothing gets a flat bonus — items or techniques.** Phase 8C found two of the
three Super stances still granting flat lifts that rotted across a lifetime
(`hawks_eye` +115% crit at level 1, +21% at the cap; `bloodlust` charging double
Vigor for +5%). All five stance lifts are multipliers of the character's own stat
now, and the report audits every lift for it.

`/reload` and `/content` (dev-only) hot-swap the bundle in **parse → validate →
live-check → build → install** order, where `install` is the only infallible step
and last — a refused reload leaves the running game on exactly the snapshot it
was serving. Lingo is NOT reloaded; new strings still need a restart.

**Current digest baseline: `583a32cb5a9d9dc7`** (schema **v8**)
(`records 7b3a5e700d0b8fe7` · `tuning 5946bb13b530389e` ·
`spawns 81f6639962cbc4a7` · `quests 2e52ecdfa45276ec`). Phase 8C moved the first
two and left the last two alone — no selection logic or daily assignment was
touched, and the digest says so rather than asking to be believed.

⚠️ **No live Telegram pass since the rebalance began.** Every formula the player
touches changed in Phase 5, every item's stat in Phase 6, and the stances plus
the failed-Flee counter in Phase 8C. `/reload` itself has never run against a
real database.

### How content works now

All 12 catalogs and all six tuning tables are façades over a snapshot
installed at boot:

```
content/data/*.json → ContentLoader → ContentValidator → GameContent (DTOs)
                                                       → DomainContent → Catalogs.current
```

Adding content is a **JSON edit plus locale keys in both `en.json` and
`uk.json`** — never a Swift array edit, because there are none left. Locale keys
are derived from ids (`item.<id>`, `plot.type.<type>.name`,
`fortune.card.<id>.*`, `quest.<id>.title`) and the validator demands each exists
in both locales.

`ContentBootstrap.load` runs in `configure` **before the database block** — the
dev-seed and `backfillWeaponDurability` both touch a catalog later in the same
function, and a catalog read before install traps. **No `static let` anywhere may
reference a catalog** — that is a real trap, not a theoretical one:
`FortuneCatalog.lookup` was `Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: all.map …)` and
would have run at type-init the moment `all` started reading the snapshot.

The migration loop that got us here, its verification layers and every gotcha
live in `.memory/content-pipeline.md`.

### Commands

```
/content   /reload                           # dev-only, in Telegram: inspect and hot-swap
swift run roi-content validate --strict      # content integrity; exit 1 on any error
swift run -c release roi-content simulate    # balance sweep; --runs/--seed/--levels, --strict gates
swift run RestOfIryna --content-digest       # confirm ONLY the intended change moved
swift test                                   # 192 tests, ~0.14s
```

## What Works Now (shipped game)

Registration · exploration (active + passive, three-tier visit decay, restart-safe
scheduler) · turn-based PvE combat with 9 class techniques · estate (plots,
warehouse, workshop, kitchen, weapon/bag/estate upgrades, technique gates) ·
capital hub (travel, Trader, Tavern with dice/darts, Fortune Teller, Master with
durability + enchant, player Market, synchronous Trade) · Guilds (roster, invites,
item vault, silver treasury) · Arena (live PvP duel, Honor ELO, stakes, daily
budget) · daily NPC quests derived from a stable hash + quest journal.

Every daily system keys off `GameDay` (rolls at **12:00 Kyiv**). EN + UK
localization (955 / 976 keys). Auth is still gated to 4 hardcoded TG IDs.

⚠️ `tuning/time.json` → `scale` is **60**, so every game-time gate is 60×
compressed and the validator warns about it. Deliberate; Phase 11 sets it to 1.0.
Nothing under `realTime` is affected — Telegram's 24 h dice-delete window, the
trade TTLs and the 12:00 rollover never scale.

| `Swift/Helpers/ContentDigest.swift` | `--content-digest`: records + spawn replay + daily-quest replay. Run before/after any content edit to confirm ONLY the intended change moved |
| `Modules/ROISim/CombatMath.swift` | The combat model itself. `CombatService` delegates here — add a roll THERE, never a second copy |

## Rules

- After significant work update `.memory/sessions.md`, `.memory/status.md` and `TODO.md`
- Ask before committing; short compact messages, no co-author line
- **Never push** — manual/user-side only
- New locale keys go in BOTH `en.json` and `uk.json`; uk gendered copy uses `.m`/`.f`
- Telegram `callback_data` max 64 bytes
- Content changes: `roi-content validate --strict` must pass before commit
- Balance-table changes (`combat` / `progression` / `budget` / archetypes): re-run
  `roi-content simulate --strict` too — the digest says what moved, the simulator
  says whether it is survivable
- Hand-edit `content/data/*.json` in the Swift `JSONEncoder` style already there
  (`"key" : value`, keys sorted, 2-space indent) — a python-style re-emit reformats
  every line and buries the real change
